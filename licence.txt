                           CCP4 Software Licence

PREAMBLE

The purpose of this document is to state the terms and conditions under which 
the CCP4 Program Suite software and documentation as defined at Annex 1 ("the 
CCP4 suite") may be used.


NOTICE TO USER:

BY USING THE SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY 
TO ITS USE.

1.	The CCP4 Suite is compiled at Daresbury Laboratory with support from 
the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK 
as part of the Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 (CCP4), on Protein 
Crystallography, first set up in October 1979.

2.	Any opinion, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in the 
CCP4 program suite are those of the authors/contributors and do not necessarily 
reflect the views of the BBSRC.

3.	The CCP4 suite is in part the property of the Council for the Central 
Laboratory of the Research Councils ("CCLRC"). Additionally extra modules may 
be supplied which are not specifically owned by the Council. These may be the 
copyright of a third party and are distributed under terms, which as far as 
the Council is aware, permit them to be included within the terms of this 
Licence. If this is so this notification or declaration that the information is
in the public domain will be included in the files. The Council shall, in all 
good faith, distribute these modules in compliance with the terms and 
conditions as set down by the third party. The Council shall not be liable and 
shall take no responsibility for any module that is not the property of the 
Council.

4.	The CCP4 suite is made available free of charge for use by non-profit 
educational, academic and research institutions. However, as the distribution 
of the CCP4 suite can prove to be an expensive commitment, non-profit 
institutions requiring versions to be distributed on magnetic tape or disk may 
be asked to pay for the time and media involved. No recipient of the CCP4 suite
and or material shall offer magnetic tapes, microfiche, listings or any further
CCP4 item for sale as a commercial item. 

5.	For items of the CCP4 suite considered as being of Part (i) (Annex 1), 
(and for items considered as Part (ii) (Annex 1) of the CCP4 distribution that 
do not have an explicit statement of warranty then the following warranty 
statement also applies) these are supplied under the following conditions:- 

	i)	The CCP4 suite is provided to the user "as is" and neither CCLRC
          nor the original authors/contributors make any warranty as to its use,
          performance or results which the user may obtain by using the CCP4 
          suite. CCLRC makes no warranties, express or implied, as to 
          non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or fitness 
          for any particular purpose. In no event will CCLRC or original 
          authors/contributors be liable to the user for any consequential, 
          incidental or special damages, including any lost profits or lost
          savings, even if a CCLRC representative or original 
          authors/contributors has been advised of such damages, or for any 
          claim by any third party.


6.	For items of the CCP4 suite considered as being Part (ii) and 
Part (iii) (Annex 1), if the authors have given a statement of copyright and 
warranties then those notices apply to those items of the CCP4 suite.

7.	As part of CCP4's two goals of preserving the free status of all of 
our free software (and derivatives), and of  promoting the sharing and reuse 
of software generally, then for items of software considered as being of 
part (i) (Annex 1), the CCP4 library routines, you are permitted and encouraged
to use, copy, modify and distribute this software and its documentation for 
any purpose and without fee. A notice to 'CCP4/Daresbury Laboratory' must 
appear in all copies, and the User must do the following:

(a)	cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change, and to provide those changes 
back to the community;

(b)	for the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
or in part contains the Part (i) (Annex 1) routines or any part thereof, 
either with or without modifications, then any subsequent licence that you 
charge to all third parties must exclude the CCP4 Part (i) (Annex 1) software 
and such Part (i) (Annex 1) software can only be included under the terms of 
this Conditions of Distribution (except that you may choose to grant warranty 
protection to some or all third parties, at your option).	

8.	For a single site that requires more than one implementation of the 
CCP4 distribution the User may copy verbatim copies of the CCP4 distribution 
as they receive it, in any medium at that site, provided that the User 
conspicuously and appropriately publishes on each copy an appropriate copyright
notice and disclaimer of warranty.

9.	The User may not copy, modify, sublicence, distribute or transfer the 
CCP4 suite except as expressly provided under either this agreement or as in 
the case of the CCP4 suite considered as either Part (ii) or Part (iii) 
(Annex 1) by the Copyright notices of the original authors. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicence, distribute or transfer the CCP4 suite 
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the CCP4 suite 
under this Agreement.	

10.     Neither the CCLRC nor the original authors are under any obligation to 
maintain the CCP4 suite nor to respond to requests for information from the 
User. 

11.	The provision of any version of the CCP4 suite under the terms and 
conditions specified herein does not imply that future versions will also be 
made available under the same terms and conditions.

12.	For any publication arising from use of the CCP4 program suite, a 
reference to (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) should be 
given as:

COLLABORATIVE COMPUTATIONAL PROJECT, NUMBER 4, 1994.
"The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography". Acta Cryst. 
   D50, 760-763.

along with any additional references, required by the original authors, 
pertaining to individual programs where the use of the programs contributed 
to an investigation.

solely at the following address:

 ANNEX 1

The CCP4 Program Suite consists of three parts:

i)	The set of Library routines for the handling of MAP files, MTZ files 
and PDB files and the general routines for DISKIO, CCPLIB, (parts of) MODLIB, 
FFTLIB, PLOT84LIB, SYMLIB, CCIFLIB, HARVLIB, LIBHTML, should be regarded as 
'Free-Software', with Copyright still remaining with the original authors 
and/or their place of employment where that software was written as employees 
in the course of their employment, and is freely available from CCP4 and the 
BBSRC.
	This software is held in the subdirectories src and ccif in:
	CCP4_MASTER: [CCP4.LIB] (for the VMS distribution),
	%CCP4_MASTER%\ccp4\lib (for DOS based systems),
	and $CCP4_MASTER/ccp4/lib (for the Unix distribution).

ii)	Contributed programs which use the part (i) library routines. For this 
set of software all copyrights remain with the original authors of the code. If
a Part (ii) program does not contain a Copyright notice then this Copyright 
notice applies.
	Examples of this software are held in directories:
	VMS: CCP4_MASTER: [CCP4.SRC];
	DOS: %CCP4_MASTER%\ccp4\src;
	Unix: $CCP4_MASTER/ccp4/src

iii)	Other independent works which have been merely aggregated to the CCP4 
distribution media, where the Advisory Notices and/or Copyright Notices for 
this other work allow for the free distribution of that code. This set of 
software (or their derivatives) that are held on the CCP4 volume of storage 
or distribution medium are not brought under the scope of the terms of the 
CCP4 distribution conditions.
	Examples of this software are held in the directories:
	VMS					Unix
	$CCP4_MASTER:[XTAL.WULFF]		$CCP4_MASTER/wulff
	$CCP4_MASTER:[XTAL.LAUE]		$CCP4_MASTER/laue
			

The distribution tape and ftp area contains copies of all programs in the CCP4 
suite (source code) plus documentation and shell files for running the programs
interactively.
