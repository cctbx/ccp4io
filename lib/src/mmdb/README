2. KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS
====================================================

--------------------------
Version 1.05 (26.03.2004)
--------------------------

1. CAtom::GetBonds ( RPSAtomBond AtomBond, int & nAtomBonds );

now returns a pointer to internal list of bonded atoms. Therefore
application MUST NEITHER attempt to deallocate AtomBond obtained from
this function NOR modify it (doing so will cause crash). This is in
difference of previous versions where deallocation of AtomBond was
explicitely required.

2. CAtom::GetBonds ( RPSAtomBondI AtomBondI, int & nAtomBonds );

on contrary, now returns an allocated instance of the atom's bond list.
If AtomBondI is not NULL on input, the function attempts to deallocate
it (which will cause crash if you feed uninitialized non-NULL AtomBondI
into the function). Application is responsible for deallocation of
AtomBondI when appropriate.

3. CAtom::GetBonds ( PSAtomBondI AtomBondI, int & nAtomBonds, int maxlength );

is a new function for pre-allocated AtomBondI[0..maxlength]. Application
is responsible for allocation and deallocation of AtomBondI.

4. CAtom::GetBonds ( RPSAtomBond AtomBond, int & nAtomBonds, int maxlength );

removed as there is no need in it in view of change #1 above.
